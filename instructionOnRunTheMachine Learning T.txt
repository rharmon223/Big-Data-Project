A basic description of the idea:

First we use the multivariateRegression.py to train on the historic commodity data and get and record the weights for each commodity.

Secondly, we train an ARMA model for each of the selected commodity and make a prediction for teach of the commodity price and after that use the weight from step 1 to calculate the prediction of the S&P500 Index. 



To run the code, please follow the steps below:

1. Please run the multivariateRegression.py


2. Please record the coef on the printed table as the weight, w_i, for each of the commodity, x_i, and a constant term.


3. Please run the ARMA.py to calculate get the predicted value for each of the selected commodity X_i.


4. Please use the formula to calculate the prediction value for next day's S&P500: S&P500Index = w_1*X_i + .....+ w_i*x_i + Constant


######
Just in case, if there's problem.

The weights/ coefficient based on the tested data, from the multivariateRegression should be

c = [1.1640, 1.2042, 0.0014, -0.2324, 0.0373, 0.8208, -0.0134, -0.0337, 0.2483, -5.4422]
