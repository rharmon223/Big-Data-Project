A basic description of the idea:

First we use the multivariateRegression.py to train on the historic commodity data and get and record the weights for each commodity.

Secondly, we train an ARMA model for each of the selected commodity and make a prediction for teach of the commodity price and after that use the weight from step 1 to calculate the prediction of the S&P500 Index.
